# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However

# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed.

# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
#   and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
#   files that we want to exclude
#
# For updates, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects

#####
# ignore compiled libs

# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

*.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
#    NB: also, whitelist the default ones, some projects need to use these
!default.pbxuser
!default.mode1v3

# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings, often included in workspaces
#
# You can safely ignore the xcuserdata files - but do NOT ignore the files next to them
#


####
# XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
#
# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
#
# Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
#
# (root)/
#   (project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     project.xcworkspace/
#       contents.xcworkspacedata
#       xcuserdata/
#         (your name)/xcuserdatad/
#     xcuserdata/
#       (your name)/xcuserdatad/

#
# Xcode 4 workspaces - SHARED
#
# This is UNDOCUMENTED (google: "developer.apple.com xcshareddata" - 0 results
# But if you're going to kill personal workspaces, at least keep the shared ones...
#
#
!xcshareddata


####
# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!

*.moved-aside


####
# UNKNOWN: recommended by others, but I can't discover what these files are
#
# ...none. Everything is now explained.
